I'm a 27 year old writer and artist who is learning a bit about being the boss of my own website. My friend Dakota is helping me with this task. It used to really overwhelm me but now I'm trying to be more resilient when it comes to approaching big tasks. 
My favorite food fluctuates with the weeks and seasons. I always enjoy cooking and wish that I did it more.
Sometimes I am preoccupied with the future.
My favorite Christmas tree ornament is the porcelain unicorn.
